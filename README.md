# Mark and Recall Vehicles

A fork of the orginal Mark and Recall that will transport the vehicle you are commanding (mount, cart, wagon, ship) as well as any creatures being led.

Logic for transporting vehicles and creatures was taken from bdew's Highway Portals mod. Thanks bdew!


Note: A new property has been added to the properties file

If you decide to use this mod, please be sure to remove the existing Mark and Recall mod. Also, be sure to test out all the various scenarios on your particular server as experience tells us that no 2 Wurm servers are exactly the same!
